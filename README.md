Landing-Page

The Landing-Page project is a generic layout web template that can be used for several different purposes.
This project was accomplished using both HTML for the webpage structure and CSS for styling. The CSS Flexbox Layout was the
primary layout model used. 

Functionality has not been added to this webpage and should only be used as a template.
